> Professional Python project: relational data and SQL analytics.

Data analytics requires a variety of skills.
This course builds capabilities through working projects.

In the age of generative AI, durable skills are grounded in real work:
setting up a professional environment,
reading and running code,
understanding the logic,
and pushing work to a shared repository.
Each project follows the structure of professional Python projects.
We learn by doing.

## This Project

This project introduces **relational data and SQL** used when storing structured data in tables.
Analysts are typically highly skilled at both SQL and Python.

Sample datasets are provided in the `data/raw` folder
across several topic domains:

- **retail** - a store records many sales (the worked example)
- **library** - a library branch manages many checkouts
- **shelter** - a shelter manages many animal adoptions
- **civic_event** - an event manages many attendees

Each domain has two related tables in a 1-to-many relationship.
You will run the retail example, then implement the same pipeline for a domain you choose.


## Command Reference

### In a machine terminal (open in your `Repos` folder)

After you get a copy of this repo in your own GitHub account,
open a machine terminal in your `Repos` folder:

```shell
# Replace username with YOUR GitHub username.
git clone https://github.com/ajaneh/datafun-05-sql

cd datafun-05-sql
code .
```

### In a VS Code terminal

These are listed for convenience.
For best results, follow the detailed instructions in
[pro-analytics-02 guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/).

```shell
uv self update
uv python pin 3.14
uv lock --upgrade
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade

uvx pre-commit install

git add -A
uvx pre-commit run --all-files
# repeat if changes were made
uvx pre-commit run --all-files

# run the example pipelines (duckdb and sqlite)
uv run python -m datafun.app_retail_duckdb_case
uv run python -m datafun.app_retail_sqlite_case

# do chores
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run python -m pyright
uv run python -m pytest
uv run python -m zensical build

# save progress
git add -A
git commit -m "update"
git push -u origin main
```

</details>

## Notes

- Use the **UP ARROW** and **DOWN ARROW** in the terminal to scroll through past commands.
- Use `CTRL+f` to find (and replace) text within a file.
- You do not need to add to or modify `tests/`. They are provided for example only.
- Many files are silent helpers. Explore as you like, but nothing is required.
- You do NOT not to understand everything; understanding builds naturally over time.

## Troubleshooting >>>

If you see something like this in your terminal: `>>>` or `...`
You accidentally started Python interactive mode.
It happens.
Press `Ctrl+c` (both keys together) or `Ctrl+Z` then `Enter` on Windows.
